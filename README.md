CSS Buttons
===========

A collection of buttons using only CSS3
--------------------

Literally a css (and less) file to allow you to turn a simple div into a shiny button you'd find on you grandmothers favourite cardigan.

Take a look at an example on my [experiments page](http://david.darn.es/experiment/button/).

Usage
--------------------
Just copy this file into your work folder and use a less @import in your main less file. To change the colour either change the colour referenced next to @button-colour or duplicate the whole class and create as many colours as you like.
