CSS Buttons
===========

### Literal CSS Buttons

Literally a CSS (and less) file to allow you to turn a simple div into a shiny button you'd find on you grandmothers favourite cardigan.

Take a look at the examples on my [experiments page](http://david.darn.es/experiment/button/).

### Usage
Just [download this repo](https://github.com/daviddarnes/css-buttons/archive/master.zip), copy the [css file](https://github.com/daviddarnes/css-buttons/blob/master/button.css) into your project, and link it like any other css file. 

### Less Mixin

If you're using less preprocessing you can using [the mixin](https://github.com/daviddarnes/css-buttons/blob/master/button.less#L123-L154) in the button.less file.
Just copy [the less file](https://github.com/daviddarnes/css-buttons/blob/master/button.less) into your work folder and @import it into your main less file. To change the colour either change the colour referenced next to [```@button-colour```](https://github.com/daviddarnes/css-buttons/blob/master/button.less#L126) or duplicate the whole class and create as many colours as you like.
